# IoT.Starter.Pi.Thing		

### IoT Starter Pi Thing develops a cell for Home Intelligence using a Raspberry Pi with Linux.

IoT Starter Pi Thing includes the basic stuff to be included in any `Thing`, which means future projects are expected to start from this `Thing`. The `Thing` is an embryo of an IoT device, with the objective of helping us to start managing ambient light, air conditioner, home theater, and other functionality at home.

For most IoT Home Intelligence projects, the Raspberry Pi (RPI) with arm 32-bit CPU is supposed to be equipped with custom hardware like temperature and humidity sensors, proximity sensors, and maybe switches and motors to open doors and windows. Also, infrared leds are very interesting components to be explored, since they enable RPI to output commands to home appliances, as a universal remote control.


### 1. Specs

Modeling and development follows API First strategy, in order to define the services provided by the `Thing`. The API, taken as a sample for this project, can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/motta/home/1.0.1). Depending on the `Thing` you need, adjustments should be done at current API, in order to reach the goals.

- The API modeling should decompose the intelligence of the `Thing` concerning security, control and data access.
- Programming and Development (P&D) will be accomplished at speedy x64 micros with Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2017 exploring .NET Core 2.0 and ASP.NET Core 2.0 platforms.
- Deployment at RPI is based on Docker containers. As shown at this Alex Ellis [tutorial](https://blog.alexellis.io/dotnetcore-on-raspberrypi/ "Build .NET Core apps for Raspberry Pi with Docker"), code is generated at x64 machine,  containers are pushed to the cloud and then pulled back to be deployed at the RPI.
- The `Thing` is supposed to be installed at some location (coordinates or zip code) and internal zone inside location (0-n);
- Each `Thing` will be designed to handle home environment (temperature, humidity), lighting, sound (music, video), human presence, etc.
- The `Thing` may access external web, in order to store and retrieve info related to its activities;
- A temperature (optionally also humidity) sensor is mandatory at any `Thing`. It is expected that temperature (and humidity)  of each `Thing` be reported to external web;
- The `Thing` is based on the [IoT.Starter.Pi.Core](https://github.com/josemotta/IoT.Starter.Pi.Core "IoT.Starter.Pi.Core") which means home-web and home-ui are the starting projects.

### 2. Setup

IÂ´m using for test a RPI 2B and I just got some RPI 3B and RPI Zero W to check.

#### Operating System

The RPI is supposed to be installed with following: 

- **Linux Raspbian GNU/Linux 9.1 (stretch)**. [Lite version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) is the minimal image based on Debian Stretch, used to initialize the `Thing`. Generate the Micro SD Card at your micro with [Etcher](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pi-sd-etcher/), for example, and boot the RPI.
- Then, it is wise to **update/upgrade** everything. Follow this [tutorial](http://thinghub.net/blog/2015/08/31/setup-raspberrypi-with-minified-raspbian-minibian/) published by Tlindener in 2015. Skip the beginning, starting at step 3. If you need the configuration program raspi-config, it is already available at Lite version. 
- **Docker** is available for RPI since 2016, please check this [post](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/docker-comes-to-raspberry-pi/) from Matt Richardson, director of Raspberry Pi Foundation North America. Many other tutorials are also available for Docker setup at RPI. 

#### Temperature Sensor DS18B20 1-wire

The `Thing` is supposed to be attached to a temperature sensor. In order to better explore the built in `1-Wire` technology available at Linux, the DS18B20 is featuring at this `Thing`. Please see more details below.

Other popular temperature sensors are available, for example the DHT22 allows temperature and humidity readings from the same component. Please check this [post](https://www.hackster.io/adamgarbo/raspberry-pi-2-iot-thingspeak-dht22-sensor-b208f4) from Adam Garbo, containing valuable info to get RPI running.

##### DS18B20 Digital Thermometer

##### 1-Wire setup

In order to activate Linux drivers, it is necessary to append the configuration below to `/boot/config.txt` (no spaces) and reboot. Sensor `Data In/Out` pin is wired to `GPIO 4` of RPi, header `pin 7`.

    # Enable 1-wire interface
    dtoverlay=w1-gpio-pullup,gpiopin=4

##### Commands

	#Start
    modprobe w1_gpio
    modprobe w1_therm

    #List
	lsmod | grep w1

	#Read the temperature
    cd /sys/bus/w1/devices
    cd 28-*
    cat w1_slave

Following is a screenshot related to temperature sensor. First, the `lsmod` command filtered by `grep` shows w1-related modules. Then, navigating through `/sys/bus/w1/devices/` we check sensors details, for example, the unique sensor id for my DS18B20 is "28-00000523113b", shown at directory name below. Other similar components tied to 1-wire bus would be properly identified as well.

	pi@lumi:~ $ lsmod | grep w1
	w1_therm                6401  0
	w1_gpio                 4818  0
	wire                   32619  2 w1_gpio,w1_therm
	pi@lumi:~ $ cd /sys/bus/w1/devices
	pi@lumi:/sys/bus/w1/devices $ ll
	total 0
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Dec 18 18:27 28-00000523113b -> ../../../devices/w1_bus_master1/28-00000523113b
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Dec 18 18:27 w1_bus_master1 -> ../../../devices/w1_bus_master1
	pi@lumi:/sys/bus/w1/devices $ cd 28-*
	pi@lumi:/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000523113b $ ll
	total 0
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 Dec 18 18:28 driver -> ../../../bus/w1/drivers/w1_slave_driver
	-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Dec 18 18:28 id
	-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Dec 18 18:28 name
	drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    0 Dec 18 18:28 power
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 Dec 18 18:28 subsystem -> ../../../bus/w1
	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Dec 18 18:28 uevent
	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Dec 18 18:28 w1_slave
	pi@lumi:/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000523113b $ cat w1_slave
	bc 01 4b 46 7f ff 04 10 d2 : crc=d2 YES
	bc 01 4b 46 7f ff 04 10 d2 t=27750
	pi@lumi:/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000523113b $

After reading the temperature from our component with `cat w1_slave` command, the value appears at bottom, after "t=". The actual temperature is 27.750 degrees Celsius and "YES" means that CRC was checked OK after DS18B20 transmitted the info to RPI. A simple and safe device that can be multiplied, thanks to the 1-wire bus technology.

Please note that this is available **out of the box**, from the Lite version of Linux Raspbian operating system.

### 2. SSL reverse proxy

How about security? Which protocols should be used? `Http` is fine or cryptography should be added through `https`?

Since the `Thing` is based on the [IoT.Starter.Pi.Core](https://github.com/josemotta/IoT.Starter.Pi.Core "IoT.Starter.Pi.Core"), `http` protocol through ports `80` and `5010` are being used to communicate with outside world, respectively by `home-ui` and `home-web` projects. Behind the scenes, this code is supposed to be a Kestrel implementation of the web server provided by ASP.NET Core.

In order to keep `home-ui` and `home-web` away from the security questions, this [post](https://medium.com/@oliver.zampieri/self-signed-ssl-reverse-proxy-with-docker-dbfc78c05b41) from Oliver Zampieri shows how to *set up a reverse proxy with `NginX` in a docker container, and configure it with self signed certificates*. 

A new `proxy.Dockerfile` is created to handle security protocol, and secure the `Thing` device using  `htpps` and SSL. 

	# Self-signed SSL reverse proxy with docker
	#
	# Starting from arm32v7/nginx image, based on Oliver Zampieri post below.
	# https://medium.com/@oliver.zampieri/self-signed-ssl-reverse-proxy-with-docker-dbfc78c05b41
	#
	# Key and Cert files were generated separately at RPI:
	# /usr/bin/openssl req -subj '/CN=localhost' -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
	
	FROM arm32v7/nginx
	
	WORKDIR /app
	COPY proxy.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
	COPY key.pem /etc/nginx/conf.d/
	COPY cert.pem /etc/nginx/conf.d/
	
	EXPOSE 443
	CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]  

A new service `ssl.proxy` is added to `pi.docker-compose.yml`, as shown below. After the project is built, a new [nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/josemottalopes/nginx-proxy/) image is pushed to the cloud by P&D Team. 


	version: '3'
	
	services:
	  io.swagger:
	    image: josemottalopes/home-web
	    build:
	      context: .
	      dockerfile: src/IO.Swagger/pi.Dockerfile
	    ports:
	    - "5010"
	    network_mode: bridge
	    environment:
	      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
	
	  home.ui:
	    image: josemottalopes/home-ui
	    build:
	      context: .
	      dockerfile: src/Home.UI/pi.Dockerfile
	    ports:
	    - "80"
	    network_mode: bridge
	    environment:
	      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
	 
	  ssl.proxy:
	    image: josemottalopes/nginx-proxy
	    build:
	      context: .
	      dockerfile: proxy.Dockerfile
	    ports:
	    - "443"
	    network_mode: bridge

The `nginx-proxy` image should be deployed to RPI together with `home-ui` and `home-web`, as shown at screen shot below showing commands to run all images:

	alias yhomeui='docker run --privileged -p 80:80 -d josemottalopes/home-ui:latest'
	alias yhomeweb='docker run --privileged -p 5010:5010 -d josemottalopes/home-web:latest'
	alias yproxy='docker run --privileged -p 443:443 -d josemottalopes/nginx-proxy:latest'

After first run you should be patient to access the `Thing` device, since a lot of stuff is loaded and prepared by .NET Core and ASP.NET platforms. Please see below browser access to both  `home-ui` and `home-web`. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/t7VaJfk.png)

Please note that `home-web` is using `http` protocol. At top, the browser window from `home-ui`  shows `https` protocol being used. The self-signed certificate generates a "Not secure" alert from the browser that may be fixed installing a true certificate.
